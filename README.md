# Chimera of Gold

A mountain climbing board game, a modern descendant of the ancient Indian game of *pachisi*. 2-5 players who start the game with 5 pawns each at a base camp; move by turns, throwing dice and following several possible paths with the goal to reach the top of the mountain. Along the way they encounter all sorts of obstacles and fight against other climbers. 
The project consists of implementing the game, with good graphical interface and the possibility to play it online.
